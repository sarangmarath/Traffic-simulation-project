# Traffic simulation project


## Overview
This project is a **Traffic Simulation** system designed to demonstrate the flow of traffic using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java**.  
It allows users to visualize traffic patterns and understand how traffic signals, vehicles, and roads interact in a controlled environment.

---

## Features
- Dynamic traffic simulation with multiple lanes.
- Traffic signal control and timing.
- Vehicle movement and collision prevention.
- Interactive user interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Java backend logic for traffic calculations (if applicable).
